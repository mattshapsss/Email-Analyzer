## How the AI Decides

The AI analyzes:
- **Keywords**: "urgent", "ASAP", "immediately", "final notice"
- **Deadlines**: "due today", "expires in", "starts in 10 minutes"
- **Sender importance**: Boss, family, financial institutions
- **Content type**: Bills, meetings, legal documents
- **Action words**: "approve", "sign", "review", "respond"

## Notification Behavior

- **ALL emails trigger notifications** (not just urgent ones)
- **Urgency shown in brackets**: [HIGH], [MEDIUM], [LOW], [NONE]
- **Action status clear**: "Action Required" or "No Action Needed"
- **AI summary included**: Brief description of what to do
- **Sender identified**: Shows who it's from

This ensures you never miss an email but can quickly prioritize based on the urgency level!
