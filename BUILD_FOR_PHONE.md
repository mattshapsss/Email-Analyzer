## What Will Work on Your Phone:

‚úÖ **Working Now:**
- Gmail sign in (you're already logged in!)
- Email fetching and display
- AI analysis of emails
- Gmail push notifications set up
- Beautiful iOS 18 dark mode UI

‚è≥ **Not Yet Working:**
- Actual push notifications to your phone (need Apple certificates)
- Background refresh (need to configure in Xcode)

## Quick Test Once Installed:

1. Open the app
2. You should see "Email Analyzer Active" 
3. Send yourself an email
4. Pull to refresh - email should appear
5. Check Vercel logs to see webhook activity

The app will work great for testing! Push notifications need Apple Developer account ($99/year) to work on device.
