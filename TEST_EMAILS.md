## How to Test

1. Send these emails to your Gmail account
2. Watch Vercel logs: `vercel logs --follow`
3. See AI analysis in real-time
4. Check notification format

The AI should correctly identify:
- Urgency level based on context
- Whether action is required
- What specific action to take
- Who sent the email

This proves the AI is working intelligently, not just matching keywords!
